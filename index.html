                <p>The Class arachnida is a large and diverse group. Arachnida is a class of joint-legged invertebrate animals, in the subphylum Chelicerata.</p>
                <code>The meaning of ARACHNIDA is a large class of arthropods that are mostly air-breathing by means of trachea or book lungs.</code>
                <p>Examples of arachnids include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>spiders</li>
                    <li>scorpions</li>

                <p>The Crustacea are a subphylum of the animal phylum Arthropoda. This is a large and diverse group with more than forty thousand species</p>
                <code>Most species of Crustacea are aquatic and are found especially in salt water.</code>
                <p>Examples of crustaceans include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>crabs</li>

                <header>Chilopoda</header>
                <p>The Chilopoda are a group of predatory arthropods more commonly known as centipedes. Earth centipedes are very long and slender and usually found in moist habitats such as under rocks and logs or in leaf litter.</p>
                <code>Centipedes have long, flattened, worm-like, segmented bodies. They can have 12-100 body segments. They have long, jointed antennae on their heads.</code>
                <p>Examples of chilopoda include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>house centipedes</li>

                <header>Diplopoda</header>
                <p>The Diplopoda are a group of arthropods more commonly known as millipedes. The name millipede means thousand feet. Millipedes are a group of arthropods that are characterised by having two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments; they are known scientifically as the class Diplopoda, the name derived from this feature. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together.</p>
                <code>While millipedes defend themselves like other animals, they don't bite. Instead, millipedes can coil up into a ball when they feel threatened. In some instances, they can emit a fluid toxin from their glands to fight against predators such as: spiders.</code>
                <p>Examples of millipedes include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pill millipede</li>
                  <li>Julida</li>

                <p>Hexapoda is the largest subphylum within the phylum Arthropoda. The subphylum Hexapoda comprises most species of arthropods and includes the insects as well as three much smaller groups of wingless arthropods: Collembola, Protura, and Diplura.</p>
                <code>The hexapod body is divided into three regions: head; thorax; and abdomen. Appendages are uniramous and a single pair of antennae is present with three pairs of walking legs, and wings in some.</code>
                <p>Examples of hexapoda include:</p>
